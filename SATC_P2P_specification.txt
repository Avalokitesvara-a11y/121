=============================
SATC P2P TRADING PLATFORM SPEC
=============================

Purpose:
--------
This document outlines the structure of a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace for trading SATC (Satoshi Contracts)
— an internal virtual unit representing 1,000 satoshi — in exchange for fiat currency between users. The operator
acts solely as a platform provider, not a financial intermediary.

-------------------------------------
1. MODEL OVERVIEW: What Is Allowed?
-------------------------------------

- Users can trade SATC with each other via direct P2P listings.
- All fiat transactions happen directly between users (off-platform).
- The platform handles only SATC balances and matchmaking.

Regulatory Safety:
- Platform does NOT hold or process fiat money.
- Platform does NOT issue or redeem SATC for fiat.
- Platform provides no custodial wallet for fiat.

--------------------------------------
2. SATC: Internal Virtual Unit Recap
--------------------------------------

- 1 SATC = 1,000 satoshi = 0.00001 BTC
- SATC has no blockchain presence.
- SATC cannot be exchanged for crypto or money by the platform itself.
- SATC is a loyalty or utility unit tied to BTC price.

---------------------------------
3. TRADE FLOW (P2P Order System)
---------------------------------

Step-by-step:

1. User A posts an offer:
   - "Sell 1,000 SATC for $50"
   - Chooses payment method: Tinkoff, PayPal, MTS, etc.

2. User B selects the offer and clicks "Buy"

3. Platform locks 1,000 SATC from User A (escrow SATC only)

4. User B sends $50 directly to User A using chosen method

5. User A confirms receipt → SATC is released to User B

6. Dispute system triggers if User A does not confirm

----------------------------
4. PLATFORM ROLE & RULES
----------------------------

Allowed:
- Host user offers
- Lock SATC during trade
- Transfer SATC after manual confirmation
- Handle user disputes

Forbidden:
- No handling of fiat
- No fiat payment gateway
- No direct crypto exchange
- No automatic conversion between SATC ↔ real money

-------------------------
5. DISPUTE & ARBITRATION
-------------------------

- Each trade has a timer for confirmation
- If User A does not confirm receipt → User B can open a dispute
- Platform moderator steps in and manually resolves (proof: receipts, screenshots)
- Platform can slash or ban bad actors

--------------------------------
6. LEGAL DEFENSE & DISCLOSURE
--------------------------------

To stay compliant:
- Platform is a “virtual goods exchange service”
- SATC is a fictional loyalty/utility point
- Platform does not provide currency services
- No fiat or crypto balances held or transferred by platform
- All trades are voluntary peer-to-peer agreements

Recommended disclaimer:

> "This platform allows users to exchange virtual units (SATC) for third-party payments at their own risk.
> We do not handle funds or mediate fiat currency transactions.
> All SATC are fictional loyalty credits with no redeemable value outside the system."

--------------------------------------

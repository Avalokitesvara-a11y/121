SATC SYSTEM SPECIFICATION
===========================

Purpose:
--------
This document defines the structure and logic of a non-custodial, virtual BTC-based trading system
using internal accounting units called SATC ("Satoshi Contracts"). The system avoids being classified
as a derivative or financial service by design.

------------------------------------
1. UNIT DEFINITION: What is SATC?
------------------------------------

Name:        Satoshi Contract Unit (SATC)
Symbol:      SATC
Base Unit:   1 SATC = 1,000 satoshi = 0.00001000 BTC
Pricing:     SATC value is derived from the current BTC/USD price. User trades SATC against USD.

Nature:      SATC is an INTERNAL DIGITAL UNIT used purely for accounting.
             It has no representation on blockchain.
             It is not a derivative.
             It is not backed by actual BTC (though the operator may hedge real exposure internally).

Issuance:    Unlimited. Issued on demand upon user purchase.

---------------------------------------------------
2. TRADE MECHANICS (via USSD or other interface)
---------------------------------------------------

Command format: *121*asset_id*action*amount*price#

  Example: *121*1*1*50*105000#
  Means:   Buy 50 SATC (each = 0.00001 BTC) at price $105,000/BTC

Parameters:
- asset_id: numeric asset identifier (e.g., 1 = BTC)
- action: 1 = Buy, 2 = Sell, 3 = Open Short
- amount: number of SATC units to buy/sell/short
- price: price per BTC in USD (limit order). Use 0 for market.

Trading types:
---------------
- Buy:    Increase user's SATC holdings using internal USD balance
- Sell:   Reduce user's SATC holdings, credit internal USD
- Short:  Virtual position opened against BTC price.
          No actual SATC is used. PnL is computed based on market move.

-------------------------------------
3. MARGIN AND MULTIPLIER SYSTEM
-------------------------------------

Leverage is not used to avoid regulatory problems.
Instead, a simple Multiplier System is implemented:

- Multiplier (M): 1x, 2x, 3x, etc.
- PnL is calculated as:
    ΔP = (current_price - entry_price)
    Profit/Loss = ΔP * SATC amount * Multiplier

- Multiplier increases both profit and risk.
- User must have sufficient internal USD balance to cover worst-case loss.

Optional: Set margin requirement for each multiplier level.

------------------------
4. BALANCE STRUCTURE
------------------------

Users have 3 types of balances:

- USD balance: for funding and settlement
- SATC balance: virtual BTC holdings
- SHORT positions: stored separately with:
    - entry_price
    - amount
    - multiplier
    - open_time
    - PnL = (entry_price - current_price) * amount * multiplier

All balances are internal. No actual BTC or USD is moved on-chain.

-------------------------------
5. LEGAL STRUCTURE & COMPLIANCE
-------------------------------

Regulatory Risk Avoidance Strategy:

1. SATC is NOT a financial instrument.
   - It is not redeemable for BTC.
   - It is not legally a security.
   - It is not a contract for future delivery (no expiry, no settlement obligations).

2. SATC is positioned as a **virtual unit inside a game-like environment**:
   - “SATC is a virtual asset used to simulate trading experience.”
   - “It has no value outside the platform and cannot be exchanged or withdrawn.”

3. The user:
   - Has no ownership of real BTC.
   - Has no claim to any blockchain-based asset.
   - Merely engages in price speculation against a virtual unit.

4. Platform is not a broker:
   - It does not act as intermediary between buyer/seller.
   - It only maintains internal accounting and matches trades internally.

5. No real leverage:
   - Multiplier system is a controlled mathematical adjustment of exposure.
   - No borrowing, no lending, no real margin.

--------------------------------
6. USER DISCLOSURE (REQUIRED)
--------------------------------

Terms of Service should clearly state:

- “Trading SATC is a simulated activity.”
- “No cryptocurrencies are purchased or sold on your behalf.”
- “All balances are virtual.”
- “You may lose all virtual USD or SATC balance based on market moves.”
- “This is not a financial service.”

------------------------
7. EXTENSIONS (OPTIONAL)
------------------------

- Daily price feed from trusted source (e.g., Kraken API)
- Position auto-liquidation if PnL exceeds available balance
- Leaderboard and gamification
- Referral rewards (in USD or SATC)
- Optionally integrate Telegram bot or USSD frontend
